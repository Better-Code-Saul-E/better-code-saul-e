                    <h1>Proposal</h1>
                    <p>
                        The topic I have chosen for my final project is the design of a landing page for an e-commerce
                        website. This topic interests me because I strictly shop online and some of the most used
                        websites are for e-commerce platforms. We will continue to expand the digital world; the
                        importance of e-commerce websites is undeniable. The success of these online platforms is
                        heavily dependent on their ability to engage users and provide personalized experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The landing page is the first point of contact for most users of an e-commerce site. It is where
                        customers are introduced to the brand, the products, and the overall shopping experience. A
                        well-designed landing page can be the difference between a user exploring further and leaving
                        the website altogether. Therefore, focusing on creating a landing page that is optimized for
                        user engagement, ease of use, and conversion rates is a timely and relevant topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest in user experience design has grown, and this project will provide an opportunity to
                        create user-friendly interfaces that improve customer interaction and satisfaction. Designing a
                        landing page that prioritizes aesthetics and functionality will be a challenge.

                    <h2>Reasearch Artifacts</h2>
                    <h3>User Research Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        Conducting user research could be one of the steps in creating a user-centered landing page. I
                        would collect data through surveys and interviews with individuals who frequently shop online.
                        By understanding their preferences on e-commerce websites, I will be able to make design
                        decisions that align with user needs. This research will provide insights into preferred layout,
                        color schemes, organization of the content, and the importance of features like recommendations,
                        reviews, and simplified checkout.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Analysis of Existing E-Commerce Websites</h3>
                    <p>
                        I will analyze the landing pages of industry leaders, such as Amazon, eBay, and smaller
                        retailers to identify design patterns, and features that resonate with users. This will help me
                        understand common industry practices, as well as innovative approaches. Comparing and
                        contrasting different websites will also provide insight into what is working in the industry
                        and where there might be room for improvement.

                    <h3>Web Analytics Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        Web analytics data like heatmaps and user interaction, will allow me to understand how users
                        interact with landing pages once they visit. This data will give me specific insights into which
                        areas of the landing page attract the most attention, where users tend to drop off, and which
                        sections are overlooked. This artifact is extremely valuable because it is a data-driven
                        approach to designing experiences.

                    <h2>What I Hope to Learn</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the principles and practices involving the landing
                        page.
                        I want to understand the elements that make a landing page effective. Is it the layout, the
                        clarity of the message, or the visual appeal that grabs attention? How do design choices, such
                        as typography, colors, and images, influence behavior?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I plan to explore how data from research, including surveys and interviews, can guide design
                        decisions. By understanding users' preferences. I want to learn how to create a more
                        personalized experience through user personas, journey mapping, and usability testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While conducting an analysis, I will gain insights into what makes e-commerce websites
                        successful.
                        What do major retailers prioritize on their landing pages? What elements do they incorporate to
                        attract, engage, and convert users? This will help me learn how to design with best practices in
                        mind while also thinking creatively about opportunities for innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the semester, I hope to have developed a strong understanding of websites. I aim to apply this knowledge in a practical and meaningful way. 
                        While doing so, I hope to grow my knowledge of design and user experience.
                    </p>
